# Inventory Management System
We are creating an inventory management system that will be linked with my sql database. It will be albe to read, create, update and delete into the databse I created.
## Getting Started
Create a mySQL instance in Google Cloud Platform
Pull the code to my eclipse using git bash, then change the ip addresses of the of the mysql databses to your own databases ip inside Java.
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
If someone wanted to use my code.
### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.
To use my code you will need to install:
Git Bash

Eclipse

Java

Maven

mySQL

Google Cloud Platform

### Installing
1. Set up the google cloud instance.
2. Pull the repository from githb and the commands that go with.
Commands are :
Git init.
Git pull https://github.com/Ayosi10/new.git
3.Open the repository into your IDE (I RECOMEND USING ECLIPSE).
4.Change all database connections within the code to their own database ip, these are located within the classes ims and all DaomySQL.

Now you will want to run your code in Eclipse.
1.Click run or  click Ctrl F11.
2.The console will now open up  and you will need to type in the username and password of your own SQL database.
3.Once you have typed in your password you will see a bunch of table names.
4.If you type in a table name it will return a bunch of commands.
5.These commands will allow you to perform a specific function depending on what they are meant to do.
6.For example if you type in READ, it will return all the information in that table into your Java Console.

## Running the tests
To run a test you will need to right click the class of the test and run as a .
### Unit Tests
Explain what these tests test, why and how to run them
They test whether the code works.
